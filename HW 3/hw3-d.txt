The Microsoft Azure is more convenient than my own laptop, especially
when running complicated queries. I tried to run some of the queries of
this assignment on my own laptop, but it was super slow and I notice that
the memory is used up to more than 95% sometimes, which was very close 
to get crasheed. Also, when the data size is huge, we do not have to
save them on our own devices if we can access to DBMS cloud services
similar to Azure.
But Azure is also not perfect, its performence depends on the speed of
the network. The network in my dorm is not very stable sometimes, leading
to mulitple times of disconnection on Azure and it showed someting like,
"unable to connect with the sever".
I think offering a DBMS in a public cloud service has business potential.
But the stability and speed of connection and the security can be 
challenges for this service.
